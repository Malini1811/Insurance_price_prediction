#  Insurance Cost Prediction Web App

This is a Flask-based web application that predicts the **medical insurance charges** for individuals based on personal attributes such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and more. The model was trained using linear regression.

##  Project Features

- User-friendly web interface to input insurance details
- Machine learning model predicts medical insurance costs
- Pre-trained regression model stored as `regression.pickle`
- Flask backend handles routing and prediction logic
- Modular HTML templates (e.g., form page, result page, thank you page)
